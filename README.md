 Zero Knowledge Age Verifier

This project is a proof-of-concept web application demonstrating
privacy-preserving age verification aligned with UIDAI principles.

## Problem
Service providers require age verification but should not access
Date of Birth or Aadhaar number.

## Solution
A Zero Knowledge approach where only a boolean age proof (Above/Below threshold)
is shared.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Disclaimer
This is a demo application. No real Aadhaar data or UIDAI APIs are used.
